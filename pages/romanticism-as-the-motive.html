							Romanticism was in full swing by the time the brothers emerged as writers, but Isabel dos
							Santos pinpoints how its influence was selective even during its peak. The Romantic
							intellectual era was one when artists expressed their imagination in a grand and vigorous
							way. As Isabel dos Santos puts it: “[p]eople longed for simplicity in human relations in
							times of strife and hardship during political oppression, for metaphysical security in an
							increasingly secular world, for a naive belief in miracles and natural wonders and for the
							fascination of an existence beyond sexual drive” (16). She offers that Germany was not
							immune to this movement, as “German Romantics [...] encouraged a revolutionary and
							philosophical stance: instead of embracing the rational and logical beliefs encouraged by
							the Age of Enlightenment (ca. 1720-1790), a focus on sensations and the irrational was
							sought, with great emphasis on intense and authentic experiences in nature, in love and in
							knowledge,” (dos Santos 2). Even though Germany was largely influenced during this era, the
							exact dates that the movement peaked in the nation highlight fallacies in arguments that
							suggest the brothers were simply Romanticists. Dos Santos importantly notes, “[a]lthough
							Romanticism was the dominant movement of the late 18th century and early 19th century, in
							Germany it developed relatively late compared to other European countries” meaning that the
							brothers may have not had been as influenced by the trend as their non-German counterparts
							(2). Despite this assertion from dos Santos, I would argue that it is difficult to know who
							Romanticism was influencing especially because historical analyses are perpetually changing.
							Admittedly, dos Santos does make a sound argument about how Romanticism as a popularized
							movement may not have been the main driving force behind the brothers’ actions because
							Romanticism emerged into cultural context later than it did in France and Britain. However,
							I will pinpoint the proto-Romantic notions in brothers' works, showcasing how nationalism
							and Romanticism work with one another to create the brothers’ beloved anthologies.

										<h3>Influences</h3>
										<p>
											Some scholars nitpick over the details within the brothers’ publications to
											find traces of Romantic influences in order to promote their claim that
											their collections of German tales are a product of that movement and only
											that movement. Many scholars associate the Brothers Grimm with Romanticism,
											mostly due to the coincidental time in which the brothers existed. However,
											a few others, including Jack Zipes, argue that the brothers’ deliberate
											edits to the tales they collected were inspired by the style of romantic
											writers such as Philipp Otto Runge (Enchanted Forests to the Modern World
											29). The brothers have also been likened to Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who is
											deemed the “Father of Romanticism” as well as a key Enlightenment-era
											philosopher. M. Schmidt Ihms understands this connection and asserts that
											the Grimms desired a “turn away from civili[z]ation and a return to nature
											[that] would restore decadent mankind to new [vigor] and creativity”
											(46-47). Moreover, according to Zipes, the brothers’ choices were similar to
											Brentano’s as they remained “more indebted to him than many scholars have
											assumed” despite the innately different stylistic decisions they made
											(Enchanted Forests to the Modern World 30). The Journal of the Folklore
											Institute’s Alfred and Mary David note, “Wilhelm [Grimm]’s prefaces reflect
											a strain of romantic primitivism that has been attributed to Rousseau”
											(David and David 186). Further supporting the claim that Romantic
											characteristics like fascination for nature were present in the brothers’
											anthologies, The Journal of the Folklore Institute asserts that the Brothers
											Grimm “unconsciously modified the stories to confirm with their idea of
											nature” (David and David 193). Thus, even though the brothers may not have
											intended on conforming to Romantic ideas, it can be argued that their works
											reflected Romanticism nonetheless.

										<h3>Agenda</h3>
										<p>
											With Rousseau’s ties to the French Revolution and his connection to the
											Grimms’ texts, some people deduce that the brothers had at least one
											political agenda in their works that stemmed from Romanticism. However, dos
											Santos ventures past this vague assumption. She declares that the brothers
											did not self-identify as Romantics despite their similarities to Romantic
											writers:
										</p>
										<blockquote style="margin: 30px 30px 0 30px;">
											The Grimms did not consider themselves part of the Romantic Movement. Their
											preoccupation lay with ancient texts which they sought to preserve for
											posterity, not with philosophical thought or poetic artistry. Their
											association with the Romantic Movement can be regarded as almost by chance,
											due rather to their political opinion and their passion for ancient folklore
											than to their following the Romantic literary programme. (dos Santos 3)
										</blockquote>
										<p>
											Dos Santos is adamant that the brothers’ agenda was the only inherently
											“Romantic” notion they carried into their works; she notes, “[t]he brothers
											took part in the Romantic Movement insofar as it suited their own cause but
											they disregarded its prescriptions: inspired by its political programme they
											followed parts of the philosophical programme but declined the poetic
											programme” (8). While it may appear paradoxical, the brothers’ aim was
											fundamentally linked to the Romantic era in the sense that they desired to
											“appeal to the childlike innocence of the soul” (dos Santos 2). However, it
											is essential to note that this “innocence” is not geared at children;
											specifically, the brothers intended on “preserv[ing] the simplicity and
											innocence that their generation - the first generation of romantic writers -
											associated with childhood and the family hearth,” (David and David 181) not
											to have their primary audience be young children. Thus, “their Romantic
											engagement was more in their attitude than in an outspoken commitment to the
											movement” (dos Santos 4).
