							The anthologies the Grimms published served as a microcosm of German culture, representing
							Germany in a good light to the world in terms of international relevance whilst effectively
							unifying it culturally. The objective nuance between nationalism and international triumph
							in authorship is complicated, as one’s success in their home nation spiraling into
							international achievement may contradict one’s motives of unifying only Germanic peoples and
							not the entire world. Thus, Maria Tatar demonstrates how “success” in authorship is defined
							by a fine line; the national and international successes of the brothers contradict one
							another in terms of the brothers’ initial drive.
						</p>
						<p>
							One reason for the international popularity is how the Brothers Grimm managed to set the
							standards for what fairy tale collecting, a subcategory of folktale preservation, should be.
							Wilhelm Grimm, in particular, has been credited for “creat[ing] the classic style of the
							Märchen-language” (Schmidt Ihms 48), setting the bar high for all others who preserve fairy
							tales the way he and his brother did. This consistency and eye for detail emerged even in
							the 1812 edition, so even after the collection of fifty tales selected for children was
							published, the phrasing remained formulaic and memorable. The attractiveness of their
							approach was impressive as David and David cite the duo’s ultimate success as the ability to
							“present [their work] in such a way that their humanity could be recognized by everyone - by
							children, by adults, and especially by later writers for whom, as the Grimms had hoped, the
							märchen[, fairy tales,] served as inspiration” (David and David 195). Schmidt Ihms even goes
							so far as to declare that the brothers’ revolutionary linguistic approach and stylistic
							choice in preserving German lore are “almost sacred like the language in the Bible” (48).
							Their way with words and complex themes gave them a reason to become more than just literary
							fads; what the Grimms have left behind is “a subtle blending of folklore and literary
							craftsmanship” (David and David 182).
						</p>
						<p>
							Thus, it is not difficult to acknowledge how the brothers revolutionized what folktales mean
							to everyday life outside of Germany. In fact, what the Brothers Grimm contributed to society
							has been diluted because what has become popularized in society does not reflect their
							entire collection. The <em>Kinder-und Hausmärchen</em> “inspired folklorists in Europe and Great
							Britain to gather tales from their oral traditions to preserve as part of their cultural
							heritage” (Zipes, “How the Grimm Brothers Saved the Fairy Tale”) which represents how
							inherently nationalistic and patriotic the <em>Kinder-und Hausmärchen</em> is. By promoting their own
							nationalistic notions in their works, they ironically revolutionized the importance of
							folktales in other countries. Specifically in the United States, <em>The Chicago Daily Tribune</em>
							noted interest in the Grimms’ work as popular composers in Germany decided to adapt these
							stories into operas (MacGowan). In fact, Tatar goes so far as to assert that it was the
							United States’ warm welcome to the duo’s preservation of the tales that propelled the duo
							towards worldwide acclaim. She reveals, “The American adoption and popularization of German
							folklore marked a move that consolidated the dominance of the Grimms, ironically turning
							tales that had been recruited for a nationalist agenda into an international canon,” (Tatar
							87-88). Thus, it can be argued that the works of the Grimms have become so ingrained in
							countries that are not Germany that they even ironically became a part of non-German
							cultures. Tatar concludes, “The Grimms’ <em>Kinder-und Hausmärchen</em> assumed an importance far
							beyond what the two brothers ever imagined, and in Anglo–American cultures, German folklore
							took root in ways that made it feel to many as if it were indigenous lore,” (85). This
							demonstrates how impactful the stories the brothers popularized became since these tales
							morphed into more than just literature, even over four thousand miles away.
						</p>
						<p>
							The appeal to children, politically driven or not, embodies universality that the brothers
							likely did not anticipate would drive them into the spotlight outside of their birth nation.
							Zipes suggests, “[t]he variety of their tales is often overlooked because only a handful
							have been selected by parents, teachers, publishers, and critics for special attention to
							form what we might consider today the Grimm canon,” (Zipes, <em>Enchanted Forests to the Modern
							World</em> 47). So, while only some of the tales have become hugely successful relative to their
							counterparts, these unknown stories still manage to hold significance in the context of
							global literature. Specifically, maybe the stories were favorable to children not because
							their parents were attempting to force Christian ideals onto them but because these
							fairytales resonate with children; the social hierarchies represented can be interpreted as
							parallels with the child-adult dynamic in which children are at the bottom of the hierarchy
							(Schmidt Ihms 51). Not only were children accounted for in the brothers’ works, but women
							who felt voiceless in society had access to these tales. This almost gives them
							representation that they would not have outside of society. Hence, “[t]he one work by the
							Grimms that had the most lasting influence did not have ‘German’ in its title. The
							<em>Kinder-und Hausmärchen</em>, instead, emphasized that the tales in that volume were oriented
							toward an audience of children, and that they belonged to the domestic sphere, being
							something on the order of old wives’ tales,” (Tatar 81). Furthermore, “[c]leaning up the
							<em>Kindermärchen</em> was a job that the Grimms took seriously over the decades, as they
							progressively adapted, revised, edited, polished, standardized, and miniaturized the stories
							to develop what came to be known as a <em>Märchenstil</em>, a style both child-friendly, but also in
							general terms reader-friendly,” so the brothers’ work was accessible to those who did not
							necessarily get a formal education (85). This mirroring of social norms in their stories
							made the Brothers Grimm’s anthologies impactful to more than just academics, Romantics, and
							nationalists.
						</p>
						<p>
							This intersection between creating a national identity for the sake of nationalism and
							accidentally popularizing one’s culture is ironic since the brothers had created an
							“international repertoire” instead of an innately German anthology (Tatar 86). Zipes
							remarks,
						</p>
						<blockquote>
							The Grimms wanted to bequeath the oral tales to the German people, not realizing that these
							tales would assume relevance in all cultures. Though the tales can be considered part of a
							German nationalist movement in the nineteenth century, they were also related to tales from
							many other nations, and this relationship accounts for their international appeal today.”
							(“How the Grimm Brothers Saved the Fairy Tale”)
						</blockquote>
						<p>
							This pertinence was unexpected and paradoxical. Since Americans eventually embraced the
							Grimms’ tales to be part of the American identity, the Grimms’ initial goal of creating
							something culturally rich for Germans to bond over had been overshadowed by their commercial
							success; the supposed source for German unity had become a source of international
							connection (Tatar). One reason for this is how the brothers’ national agenda became
							overlooked by the rest of the world. Schmidt Ihms suggests that the duo may have simply made
							their stories more timeless; because the political foundations can be disregarded, the
							social issues illuminated by the Grimms are applicable to any era (51). Furthermore, Tatar
							claims that in this century, it is not “logical to frame cultural spaces in national terms”
							as it had been when the brothers produced their anthologies (89). But even though the idea
							of national, ethnic, and cultural borders has changed by the twenty-first century, the fact
							that the duo’s works are recognized worldwide shows how they managed to penetrate through
							Germany’s cultural limits during a time when globalization had not peaked as it has now.
							Hence, the ironic relevance of the anthologies stood the tests of both borders and time,
							which catapulted the brothers into being the faces of German lore. This ultimately unifies
							the German identity, but it does so by way of international representation instead of just
							commonality.
