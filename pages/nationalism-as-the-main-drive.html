							Especially after the Napoleonic Wars and how they had fought on behalf of the German people,
							the Grimms felt that they wanted to neither legitimize the ruling of former German princes
							nor hand the German identity to a power like Napoleon. The existence of the princes for each
							of the sovereign states symbolized a decentralized German identity, which the brothers
							detested. But, being “united” by a foreign emperor who clustered the Germanic states
							together did not sit right with the duo either. Hence, the brothers attempted to imagine a
							German national identity that could stand on its own and be able to resist outside forces
							and domestic turmoil. Because of their innate desire to promote German resilience, it is not
							surprising that according to David and David, people generally agree that the brothers were
							intrigued by ancient Germanic literature and languages as a whole, not explicitly folklore
							(182). Zipes steers the conversation into nationalism and German pride by asserting that due
							to circumstances, the brothers began preserving German lore for their own purpose,
							nationalism, instead of the embodiment of the Romantic era. Zipes argues that
						</p>
						<blockquote>
							[w]hat compelled the Grimms to concentrate on old German epics, tales, and literature was a
							belief that the most natural and pure forms of culture—those which held the community
							together—were linguistic and based in history. According to them, modern literature, even
							though it might be remarkably rich, was artificial and thus could not express the genuine
							essence of Volk culture that emanated naturally from experience and bound the people
							together. Therefore, all their efforts went toward uncovering stories from the past. (“How
							the Grimm Brothers Saved the Fairy Tale”)
						</blockquote>
						<p>
							This complements Zipes’ grasp on the difficult situations the brothers were put into because
							of the Napoleonic era (Zipes, “How the Grimm Brothers Saved the Fairy Tale”). This feeling
							of needing to solve a problem from their formative years explains why nationalism comes into
							the picture. In 1850, the brothers were exposed to scholars in Berlin who worked to
							politicize various academic disciplines, including literature and history (Schmidt Ihms 45).
							Because the duo was exposed to political literature, they may have been inspired to be both
							ambitious and subtle in their interpretations of tales while promoting an agenda based on
							national pride and unity. Hurt and disheartened by the fractured nature of the German states
							and their personal trauma coming from the Napoleonic Wars, the Grimms made a personal effort
							to create anthologies that reflected their deep desire to create a shared German identity.
							As Zipes puts it, they felt a “deep longing to have the German people united in one nation
							through customs and laws of their own making,” (<em>Enchanted Forests to the Modern World</em>
							16-17). Here, Zipes is suggesting that the Grimms wanted to create a political culture where
							the German identity is for the people and by the people, not necessarily controlled by a
							direct force. Thus, it is likely that “the identification with the common hard-working folk
							and the great desire to prove his individual worth were major factors in Jacob’s later
							success and also figured in his idealization of the German folk,” (Zipes, <em>Enchanted Forests
							to the Modern World</em> 6). This awareness and admiration of the common man are Romantic in
							nature, but the political agenda behind the usage of these ideas boosts the notion that the
							brothers took their original intentions of creating a Romantic work into something that
							would unite their people. Hence this personal goal of one of the brothers contributes to the
							duo’s overall goal of “reconstitut[ing] German culture in its oral and written forms so that
							it would not fade from the memory of the German people,” (Zipes, <em>Enchanted Forests to the
							Modern World</em> 12).

										<h3>Sanitization</h3>
										<p>
											The general public did not have a clear idea of what the brothers had done
											to the original source texts. Specifically, not everyone was aware that what
											the brothers preserved was not exactly what they published, as many assumed.
											A few decades after the deaths of the two, an American newspaper notes,
											“Contrary to general belief, the work of the Grimm Brothers did not consist
											in simply repeating verbatim such stories as were related to them by the
											many peasants visited by them for the purpose of gathering the numerous
											beautiful specimens of German folklore, though the plot of each story told
											them has remained the same as in original version” (Neumeyer). Even now, it
											is generally agreed upon that the brothers edited their works extensively.
										</p>
										<p>
											A proposal scholars offer is that the brothers used creative liberties to
											beautify their stories into works of art instead of historical texts. <em>The
											Journal of the Folklore Institute</em> suggests that “[f]or the most part[,] the
											changes and additions are those that might be made by any good storyteller
											to make this narrative more coherent, more dramatic, and more vivid,” (191).
											Schmidt Ihms also recognizes that Wilhelm, the more creative brother, did
											indeed embellish the stories (48). Hence, Schmidt Ihm’s stance on the
											reasonings behind the Grimms’ does not blatantly side with the idea that the
											brothers were driven by national pride, but it does acknowledge that they
											did not stay true to the stories they collected.
										</p>
										<p>
											While scholars broadly agree that the Grimms edited their stories, the
											underlying motives are significant points of contention. In being deemed as
											collectors of folklore instead of creators of such tales, scholars have
											questioned the brothers’ integrity as preservers of German lore. Schmidt
											Ihms also attempts to legitimize the brothers’ actions by offering practical
											reasoning as to why the brothers opted to edit the original tales the way
											they did. With consideration to the process of folklore preservation during
											the nineteenth century, she proclaims, “[t]o safeguard the authenticity of
											the story, they set themselves the task of keeping close to the words of the
											[storyteller]. If one considers that they had neither a tape recorder nor
											even shorthand, this alone seems a formidable task,” (48). This showcases
											how Schmidt Ihms is convinced that the brothers did try not to over-edit nor
											sanitize the texts, but they did so inadvertently as it is inherent to the
											process.
										</p>
										<p>
											Academics generally accept the notion that the first edition of the
											brothers’ tales was meant for adults, not children. Zipes declares, “Their
											tales were not to be classified as children’s stories, not even today,”
											(“How the Grimm Brothers Saved the Fairy Tale”). The darkness of their
											earliest edition is a reflection of the trauma that the Grimms faced during
											their formative years; they desired to represent the dark themes that shaped
											their perception of Germany. Zipes explains that the brothers’ initial
											motive in preserving the tales they collected was to make them “about
											children and families and how they reacted to the difficult conditions under
											which they lived” instead of making the stories’ prime audiences be actual
											German children (“How the Grimm Brothers Saved the Fairy Tale”). Donald
											Haase’s work in translating the Grimms’ text shows how unwholesome and
											inappropriate the texts may have been if the brothers had not attempted to
											make it more approachable to young audiences, something that I will dive
											into in greater detail soon. In "How Some Children Played at Slaughtering,”
											grotesque acts of violence are described graphically. For instance, “In the
											afternoon, when they began playing, one child said to the other, ‘you be the
											little pig, and I'll be the butcher.’ He then took a shiny knife and slit
											his little brother's throat.” Zipes cites this specific story from the first
											edition as representative of the “stark narratives about brutal living
											conditions in the nineteenth century,” (“How the Grimm Brothers Saved the
											Fairy Tale”). Because the Grimms were so deeply traumatized by the
											Napoleonic Wars during their younger years, especially since they were
											financially unstable due to war and growing up fatherless, they desired to
											bring dark truths to their works while promoting a strong Germany that would
											prevent similar wars from taking place. Hence this represents how Napoleon
											shaped their desire to represent Germany in a way that would unify the
											sovereign states they witnessed in their youth.
										</p>
										<p>
											I am not arguing that the brothers’ works after their various editions
											emerged as more innocent as time went on. In fact, Maria Tatar claims that
											the duo “stepped-up violence in successive editions of the tales (evil must
											be punished in the moral calculus of the fairy-tale world)” (87). This
											understanding of right and wrong is a simplistic, binary awareness of the
											world, which is reminiscent of a young children’s sense of reality. It is
											just that no matter which edition, the brothers had the trauma of the
											Napoleonic Wars at the back of their minds in their approaches, whether by
											using dark themes or showcasing wholesomeness.
										</p>
										<p>
											Hence, one common theory is that the brothers wanted to make their tales
											more appropriate for children over time, switching their primary audience
											from adults over to a more innocent audience to appeal to Germans in the
											attempt at unification. This presumably pure-hearted audience would
											appreciate the simplified and glossy tales more than the darker themes, as
											they themselves may not have had exposure to such concepts. These Christian
											morals that many Germans embraced are something that Jack Zipes hones in on.
											Hence, he argues that the brothers did a significant amount of purification
											as they “eliminated erotic and sexual elements that might be offensive to
											middle-class morality, added numerous Christian expressions and references,
											emphasized specific role models for male and female protagonists according
											to the dominant patriarchal code of that time, and endowed many tales with a
											‘homey’ [...] flavor,” (Zipes <em>Enchanted Forests to the Modern World</em> 46). The
											manipulation of these stories to fit certain unsaid rules that the brothers
											had prescribed to the identity of Germans is something that I will expand
											upon later. For now, Zipes’ point on ridding of anything that would be
											offensive to the Grimm’s ideal German man showcases how desperate the duo
											was to achieve relevance amongst literate Germans. In fact, he adds that
											“[t]hey kept mending and ironing the tales they collected so that they would
											ultimately fit the patriarchal and Christian code of bourgeois reading
											expectations and their own ideal notion of pure, natural German culture,”
											(Zipes, <em>Enchanted Forests to the Modern World</em> 58). How did they get rid of
											these supposedly impure elements? Tatar seemingly implies that Romantic
											eradication of crass details occurred as she notes that “[t]he Grimms’
											slavish fidelity to oral folk traditions, in particular to the crude
											language of the folk, came under especially heavy fire. "[Romanticists like]
											August Wilhelm Schlegel and Clemens Brentano felt that a bit of artifice
											would have gone a long way toward improving the art of the folk and toward
											making the tales more appealing,” (85). So, they took elements of purity and
											emphasis on the common folk from the Romantic movement and fused them with
											Christian ideals to sanitize their texts in order to appeal to the German
											population in terms of political and national unity. Moreover,
										</p>
										<blockquote style="margin: 30px 30px 0 30px;">
											Wilhelm [took] care to refine the style [of the tales] and make the contents
											of the tales more acceptable for a children’s audience- or really, for
											adults who wanted the tales censored for children. Otherwise, the editing of
											[the brothers] exhibits the same tendencies from the beginning to the end of
											their project: the endeavor to make the tales stylistically smoother; the
											concern for clear sequential structure; the desire to make the stories more
											lively and pictorial by adding adjectives, old proverbs, and direct
											dialogue; the reinforcement of motives for action in the plot; the infusion
											of psychological motifs; and the elimination of elements that may detract
											from a rustic tone. (<em>Enchanted Forests to the Modern World</em> 30)
										</blockquote>
										<p>
											Thus, Zipes argued that instead of calling the brothers “collectors,” they
											could be referred to as “creative ‘contaminators’ and artists,” (<em>Enchanted
											Forests to the Modern World</em> 31). While this “contamination” can be perceived
											as an ode to the Romantic artistic movement, it represents nationalism a tad
											more because its agenda is very much so political.
										</p>
										<p>
											The changes that made their anthologies more simplistic and innocent were to
											their commercial advantage, thus reaching a wide German audience. The first
											edition of the <em>Kinder-und Hausmärchen</em> stayed true to the original tales in
											idea and form, but the last edition that arrived in 1857 became more
											embellished and shaped by the Brothers Grimm in order to appeal to the
											“growing literary public, (Zipes, “How the Grimm Brothers Saved the Fairy
											Tale”). By “literary public,” Zipes meant “middle-class Christians”. The
											Christianization of their tales worked to appeal to the German public, as
											parents were fond of what was available for their children to read. In fact,
											according to Zipes, if the brothers did admit to blatantly purifying
											anything, they’d likely reference their works for children, even if their
											original intent in collecting folktales was unrelated to children (<em>Enchanted
											Forests to the Modern World</em> 16). However, it is important to acknowledge
											that in order to succeed in creating a national body of work, they needed to
											appeal to a greater audience. When the <em>Kinder-und Hausmärchen</em> was first
											published, their counterparts went against them, with one deeming the
											children’s literature anthology as inappropriate for its main audience and
											others regarding the collection as “real junk” (Tatar 85). Hence, some
											adjustments were inevitable in order to make their works worth reading.
											Especially during the later years, they took advantage of the popularity of
											their tales, for “[i]t was Wilhelm Grimm himself who became aware of the
											great appeal which these folk tales had in the nursery” (Schmidt Ihms 51).
										</p>
										<p>
											Following the example of [Charles] Perrault, who had addressed himself in
											the first instance to children, Wilhelm selected fifty stories and retold
											them with children in mind,” (Schmidt Ihms 51). The Grimms explained their
											decision to appeal to children:
										</p>
										<blockquote style="margin: 30px 30px 0 30px;">
											An inner purity is found in these compositions, which is why children appear
											so wonderful and blissful to us. They have the same bluish-white faultless
											shining eyes which cannot grow anymore, while the other limbs are still
											tender, weak, and unfit for working the soil. That is the reason why we did
											not wish our collection to merely serve the history of poetry and mythology.
											It was our aim that the poetry itself – alive within the tales – would have
											an influence and delight whom it can, that it could thus serve as an
											educational tool (Grimm and Grimm 29-37).
										</blockquote>
										<p>
											So, while this “educational tool” may have been inspired by Perrault, who is
											deemed the inventor of fairy tales, this effort was helpful in solidifying
											the German national identity as many German children were brought up with
											the same tales.
										</p>
										<p>
											The brothers would deny this, however, because they maintained that they
											were not trying to stray away from the morality of the original stories.
											They only convolutedly admitted to the beautification of their work when it
											came to appealing to children. They explained,
										</p>
										<blockquote style="margin: 30px 30px 0 30px;">
											Concerning our methods of collecting material, it was faithfulness and
											truthfulness which mattered most to us. We did not add anything of our own,
											nor did we embellish any circumstance or feature of the tales. We simply
											reproduced their content just as we had received it. It is self-evident that
											the expression and execution of the details is in large part ours, yet we
											have sought to keep every unique feature that we noticed, so that in this
											way, too, the collection could be given over to nature's diversity. (Grimm
											and Grimm 29-37)
										</blockquote>
										<p>
											While it is common to cling desperately onto a sense of national pride
											during a time of turmoil, the duo has also been accused of adopting
											Nazi-like tendencies, too radical for their own good. Scott Harshbarger, in
											particular, does not think that the happy endings the brothers included were
											for the sake of being child-friendly, for “the Grimm Brothers and the Nazis
											had much in common, not the least of which was their shared interest in
											transporting their readers/followers into narrative worlds where, after a
											good deal of violent struggle with demonic adversaries, the good and pure
											could live ‘happily ever after,’” (Harshbarger 493). He expands his argument
											by suggesting that the creative liberties the brothers took were political:
											“Grimms and the Nazis were both ardent supporters of nationalism - an
											ideology which, as a number of theorists have argued, is powered largely by
											the imagination,” (Harshbarger 493). Hence, it is arguable that this
											sanitization of German lore is a nationalistic agenda.

										<h3>Patriarchal and Bourgeois Biases</h3>
										<p>
											The middle-class was the brothers’ primary audience, as their morals aligned
											with what the brothers deemed “German.” It is evident that the brothers
											aspired to, in Zipes' words, “create an ideal type for the literary fairy
											tale, one that sought to be as close to the oral tradition as possible,
											while incorporating [elements] to appeal to a growing middle-class audience”
											(Zipes, <em>Enchanted Forests to the Modern World</em> 31). Zipes explains in another
											work of his that “most of the storytellers during this period were educated
											young women from the middle class or aristocracy” showcasing that the
											brothers prioritized the contemporary norm of valuing the social classes
											that had access to formal education (<em>Enchanted Forests to the Modern World</em>
											28). Specifically, dos Santos notes that instead of speaking to poor folks
											from the rural areas of Germany, “[the stories] were retold by literate
											bourgeois ladies who were invited into the brothers' studio in the city and
											who were often paid for their services” (5). Thus, the brothers took an
											approach that was more calculated and pro-middle-class despite their initial
											intentions of focusing on spontaneity and the common folk, in line with
											Romantic ideals.
										</p>
										<p>
											As mentioned above, the Brothers Grimm were fascinated by urban life and
											disparaged provincial life, again, out of sync with the ideals of
											Romanticism. Valerie Paradiz point-blank declares that one of the brothers,
											Jacob, was “ever-critical” of provincialism. So, as dos Santos notes, the
											mere notion that the brothers preferred formal settings and the aristocracy
											contradicts the common assumption that the brothers “collected the fairy
											tales by listening to the Volk, traveling through the countryside in search
											of different versions and adaptations handed down through oral traditions.
											This rather [R]omantic notion served the times well but does not quite
											correspond to the truth” (dos Santos 4). Zipes agrees with dos Santos in
											that “[t]heir primary method was to invite storytellers into their home and
											then have them tell the tales aloud, which the Grimms either noted down on
											first hearing or after a couple of hearings” (<em>Enchanted Forests to the
											Modern World</em> 28). Hence, the Grimms did not gather their stories organically
											and in keeping with ideals of Romanticism as they simply did not enjoy the
											provincial life the stories seemingly promoted.
										</p>
										<p>
											Moreover, Zipes declares that the tales the Brothers Grimm collected and
											reworked “deal[t] with ‘bourgeois appropriation’ and the
											institutionalization of a ‘bourgeois genre,’ one that has great ramification
											for our ‘happy-end’ narratives” (<em>Enchanted Forests to the Modern World</em> 52).
											Harshbarger is cynical of these happy endings, as he deems these as
											interpretations of antagonists being representative of Germany’s political
											enemies. Because these folktales are simplistic and rural-oriented, perhaps
											the Brothers Grimm were attempting to stir emotion in provincial
											communities. Harshbarger declares, “Considering the many hardships and
											frustrations of peasant life, it's a small wonder that folktales often
											include a variety of monsters, which, in turn, help to promote a readiness
											to conceive and act against such perceived threats” (Harshbarger 498). This
											aligns with historical facts about the brothers, as they were firm believers
											of Enlightenment ideals that appealed to the bourgeois and aristocrats
											(Zipes, <em>Enchanted Forests to the Modern World</em> 55). Also considering that the
											Grimms generally did not think highly of those who resided in the
											countryside, especially those who did not have access to formal education,
											their appropriation of provincial emotions in the service of a nationalist
											agenda is not entirely implausible.
										</p>
										<p>
											Like many of their counterparts during the era, the duo embraced the notions
											of White male elitism in the name of European nationalism. Particularly,
											they not only belittled but exploited those who they deemed inferior. Women,
											lower-class men, and those who generally did not fit the mold of what the
											brothers deemed as “German” were simply not respected. The duo used their
											statuses as literate, White, Protestant German men to promote the imagined
											idea of what Germany should be full of: people just like themselves.

														The general public is aware that the tales popularized by the
														brothers often center themselves on female characters. Hence,
														scholars have questioned whether or not the tales were simply
														derived from those told by women. In <em>Clever Maids: The Secret
														History of the Grimm Fairy Tales</em>, Valerie Paradiz hones in on
														the Hassenpflug sisters who were the minds behind many of the
														tales collected and published by the Brothers Grimm in their
														anthology <em>Children’s and Household Fairy Tales</em>. Susette,
														Jeanette, Marie, and Amalia Hassenpflug were identified by
														Paradiz as four of the storytellers who were invited into the
														brothers’ homes weekly to provide them with content for their
														anthology (85-86). Specifically, Jeanette Hassenpflug was
														proactive in feeding the brothers tales such as “Puss in Boots”
														and “The Twelve Huntsmen,” which the brothers had not known
														about until they met her and her sisters (87). Her sister,
														Marie, carried the brothers’ project as nearly all of the
														stories in <em>Children’s and Household Fairy Tales</em> were hers (90).
													</p>
													<p>
														In terms of national identity, these four women offered a unique
														way of unifying Germany, blending Romantic concepts with
														nationalist ones and blurring the lines of German identity.
														Specifically, these sisters offered the brothers intricate tales
														that were rooted in Huguenot and French culture. The sisters had
														Protestant French roots as they identified as Huguenots who
														still spoke French in Germany and whose maternal grandfather was
														prosecuted for not being Catholic in his native France (Paradiz
														95-96). Elements of Romanticism grew out of their French-ness
														and were introduced into the tales. Paradiz explains,
													</p>
													<blockquote>
														It was likely Marie Magdalene and her female servants told the
														young Hassenpﬂug girls the very tales that they would in turn
														pass along to Jacob and Wilhelm for their growing collection.
														Their stories, published in the ﬁrst volume of the <em>Children’s
														and Household Fairy Tales</em>, had descended directly from the
														seventeenth-century French fairy tale tradition, and
														particularly from the stories of Charles Perrault, the compiler
														and editor of the <em>Histoires ou Contes du Temps Passé</em> (Stories or
														Fairy Tales from Bygone Eras), also known as the legendary
														Mother Goose tales. (96)
													</blockquote>
													<p>
														This assumption demonstrates how the Romantic movement, from
														Perrault to oral tradition, encapsulates the patriotic work that
														is the <em>Children's and Household Tales</em>. It is worth noting here
														that although these contributors had French roots, the brothers
														still accepted most of their input; their Protestant background
														highlights what the brothers deemed to be innately German in the
														goal of creating a nationalist anthology. So, the process of
														bringing together Germans, who may not have had ethnic German
														roots, amplified the goal of unification in this context.
														However, not all religious and ethnic differences were
														respectfully represented and not all “French” ideas were
														welcomed, something that I will discuss later on.
													</p>
													<p>
														The themes the brothers covered in their collected stories also
														highlight female plights, for their main contributors were
														females. For instance, Paradiz notes that “it seems the plot of
														‘boy meets girl’ had pervaded the fairy tale genre, and for
														Jeanette[, one of the brothers’ main storytellers,] and other
														young, unwed women of the age, the inevitable happy ending held
														out a sign of hope” (87). Another one of Jeanette’s
														contributions was the “On the Despicable Spinning of Flax,”
														which Paradiz describes as “a paradoxical narrative about
														women’s toil and women’s beauty” (87). Paradiz goes on to argue
														that the idea that a woman’s beauty in society is deemed “their
														only asset” (89). Yet again, the brothers did not give credit
														where it was due, in keeping with their White male elitist
														agenda.
													</p>
													<p>
														Despite these stories fascinating the brothers and shaping the
														entire outcome of the anthology, the Grimms never gave official
														credit to the sisters who gave them their stories. Instead of
														giving official credit to the sisters who supplied their
														stories, and despite their own fascination with the stories, the
														brothers only referenced them, describing them, as Paradiz puts
														it, “geographically in their foreword as stemming from ‘the
														region of the Main [River]’” in their published work (Paradiz
														97). So there is little room to deny that without various female
														storytellers, there would be no <em>Children's and Household Tales</em>.
														It is understood that the minds behind the Grimms’ success in
														collecting German folklore were female despite their efforts to
														conceal that and downplay the role of women in their works. As
														Paradiz puts it: “If the tales contributed by the women
														collaborators were noted only by the geographical region from
														where they came, then the deep underlying message of male
														literary culture was that women as individuals did not matter”
														(99). By ignoring the women as well as downplaying the explicit
														truth of the stories originating in France, the brothers uphold
														toxic masculinity as a representation of German nationalism.
													</p>
													<p>
														Opting to omit women from their credits showed the brothers'
														preference for a male-oriented society supporting the notion
														that nationalism was a strong motive behind the brothers’
														collection of texts. Additionally, Zipes also claims that the
														brothers’ decisions were patriarchal; they placed focus on the
														idea of “celebrat[ing] a paternal heritage of the fatherland”
														(<em>Enchanted Forests to the Modern World</em> 28). Paradiz agrees,
														citing how even the female-oriented themes were glazed over as a
														byproduct of all German folk. She explains, “[The Grimms]
														allowed the identities of their collaborators to be subsumed by
														the idea that the stories represented not the ladies themselves
														but a far greater folk spirit, much in the way that the
														all-powerful patriarch in a fairy tale can demand sacriﬁces of
														his daughter in the name of a greater good” (97-98). Given that
														the German men, including one of the two brothers, fought
														Napoleon, this obsession with unification manifests itself in
														making the German identity, including German folklore, more
														masculine.

														The Grimms’ decisions regarding whom to give credit to was
														convoluted and confusing. Other than discrediting women in their
														works, the brothers also preferred the middle-class over the
														lower classes. Schmidt Ihms asserts that one of these bourgeois
														storytellers has supposedly been identified as Dorothea Viehmann
														by many scholars, who was deemed the “prototype of the
														[storyteller… whose] picture appears in the place which[,] at
														that time[,] was usually preserved for a portrait of the author”
														(47). Further supporting her identity was the fact that her
														portrait was depicted in Louis Katzenstein's painting “The
														Brothers Grimm at the home of the Märchenfrau” (dos Santo 4).
														However, Neumeyer somewhat counters this credit as they allege
														that <em>Hansel and Gretel</em>’s original storyteller was Dorothea’s
														husband, not even Dorothea herself, as this was documented in
														his manuscript. This demonstrates the occlusion of female
														authorship common in the nineteenth century. Admittedly, other
														bourgeois storytellers did not seem favored the way Dorothea
														Viehmann had been by the duo. However, their attribution to
														Dorothea, or lack thereof, exposes how even amongst the women
														who the brothers sought inspiration and even stories from, they
														preferred those who held a relatively decent amount of status in
														society.
													</p>
													<p>
														How the Grimms slanted towards literate, middle-class men
														represented their perception of Germany as innately male, which
														implied strength in their minds. Promoting the notion that the
														brothers favored middle-class men, Neumeyer argues that it was
														actually one of the brothers’ servants who popularized some of
														the stories that others had credited the brothers for
														familiarizing to the general public. Even if it a solid
														understanding that in history, it is difficult to decipher who
														contributes to when, this theory that the Grimms did not
														acknowledge lower-class individuals like servants who
														contributed to their project is consistent with the idea that
														they exploited women and lower-class or illiterate people to
														create a Germany they imaged would succeed in the face of
														external forces like Napoleon.

														Although the duo purified many of their stories to make them
														more appropriate for children, some of their revisions left in
														crass details that are hard to merely attribute to
														Christianization. Instead, it is more appropriate and logical to
														link these elements to the post-Napoleonic trauma the brothers
														worked to highlight in their writing. <em>The Little Red Cap</em>, better
														known as <em>The Little Red Riding Hood</em>, a classic tale, is an
														example of the creative liberties the brothers took in order to
														expand their political cause. Another revolutionary fairy tale
														collector, Charles Perrault, adapted a version of this classic
														that has the wolf devouring the girl and ending there.
														Meanwhile, Ludwig Tieck’s version involves a butcher who
														attempts to stop the girl’s death, but the ending also results
														in the girl dying due to her recklessness in the woods.
														Contrasting significantly with both of these takes, [the]
														Grimm[s give] the girl a happy ending in which she is saved and
														then protects her family from another wolf (Schmidt Ihms 49).
														While this could be tied back to the idea of Romantic
														purification, Schmidt Ihms offers context on how this tale can
														be representative of German nationalism: “Less well known is the
														fact that at the beginning of the nineteenth century[,] ‘wolf’
														was not just another name for a powerful cunning enemy, but very
														specifically for the French under Napoleon.” Thus, this could be
														tied into the brothers’ nationalistic tendencies as it can be
														interpreted that the girl, whose hood represents freedom,
														represents a naive Germany that was lured by Napoleon, the wolf
														in this context (Schmidt Ihms 50). This is paradoxical, however,
														as the duo worked to make their works as masculine as possible
														logistically by discrediting women. So, it can be understood
														that although the Grimms often made their acknowledgments
														disproportionately masculine, they still wanted to represent
														Germany as an innocent female in a sense to showcase how they
														feel victimized by Napoleon. They only incorporated femininity
														through the lens of symbolization when it came to their
														advantage.
													</p>
													<p>
														Gender and class are not the only two ways the brothers attempt
														to craft their ideal German national identity in their
														anthologies, for they pushed anti-Semitic notions into their
														seemingly simplistic tales. Hence, Scott Harshbarger accuses the
														duo of using racist and sexist stereotypes against Jews in their
														stories (494). An example of this is once again found in the
														story of the little girl with the red hood. Instead of reading
														it through the eyes of a nation scarred by Napoleon, Harshbarger
														opts to read the tale for racist undertones. He notes,
													</p>
													<blockquote>
														Luring innocent children into the home in order to kill and eat
														them seems a uniquely diabolical act, especially when performed
														by a grandmotherly character. However, such ritual child murder
														was also credited to the Jews, who, according to stories, poems,
														songs, and legends circulating throughout Europe since at least
														the 12th century, regularly made a practice of abducting
														Christian children for their Satanic rituals. (Harshbarger 499)
													</blockquote>
													<p>
														Hence, the brothers did not simply Christianize their stories to
														appease bourgeois parents. By having underdogs like the little
														girl in the red hood defeat a wolf, the Brothers Grimm could
														insinuate “utopianism,” something that both Nazism, something
														inherently nationalistic, and fantastical stories share
														(Harshbarger 494). They wanted to create a German identity that
														tied to what they deemed proper: middle-class, educated, White
														Christians. So, this exclusionary interpretation of what it
														means to be “German” can support the idea that Wilhelm and Jacob
														Grimm’s anthologies represented nationalism more so than
														Romanticism in this regard.
													</p>
													<p>
														Conversely, the brothers’ definition of “German” seemed to be
														convoluted, showing that they may have offered Romanticism a
														fair chance at influencing them over nationalism. Particularly,
														the stories they ended up publishing had influences that were
														representative of pan-European culture. Paradiz remarks, “Though
														the Grimms and Hassenpﬂugs both shared deep connections to Hesse
														[...], this rich new source of stories was certainly not
														quintessentially Hessian, nor even German for that matter. In
														fact, tales such as ‘Red Riding Hood’ and ‘Sleeping Beauty’ were
														pan-European phenomena, predating even Perrault, with
														provenances tracing as far back as the Middle Ages and Ancient
														Greece” (96). It is then an interesting paradox as Zipes notes
														that “[s]ome tales, such as ‘Puss in Boots,’ ‘Bluebeard,’
														‘Princess Mouseskin,’ and ‘Okerlo,’ were also omitted because
														they were considered too French to be included in a German
														collection” (“How the Grimm Brothers Saved the Fairy Tale”). It
														is established the Hassenpﬂug sisters supplied the duo with
														these French-rooted stories and that many of these stories were
														adopted, so for the Grimms to be not-picky about which stories
														were too inherently non-German was indicative of how focused
														they were on their nationalist agenda. No matter how valuable
														the story was to their project, the most important takeaway from
														the story had to be representative of German values and pride to
														make the cut.
